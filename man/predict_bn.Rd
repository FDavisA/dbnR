\title{Performs inference over a fitted GBN}
\usage{
predict_bn(fit, evidence)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{the fitted bn}

\item{evidence}{values of the variables used as evidence for the net}

\item{cols}{names of the columns used as evidence}
}
\value{
the mean of the particles for each row
}
\description{
Performs inference over a Gaussian BN. It's thought to be used in a map for
a data.table, to use as evidence each separate row.
}
\examples{
res <- dt_test[, predict(fit, names_cols, .SD), .SDcols = names_cols, by = 1:nrow(dt_test)]
