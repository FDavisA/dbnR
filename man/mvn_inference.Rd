\title{Performs inference over a multivariate normal distribution}
\usage{
mvn_inference(mu, sigma, evidence)
}
\arguments{
\item{mu}{the mean vector}

\item{sigma}{the covariance matrix}

\item{evidence}{values and names of the variables given as evidence}
}
\value{
the posterior mean and covariance matrix
}
\description{
Performs inference over a multivariate normal distribution given some 
evidence. After converting a Gaussian linear network to its MVN form, this
kind of inference can be performed.
