Description: Learning and inference over dynamic Bayesian networks of arbitrary 
    Markovian order.  Extends some of the functionality offered by the 'bnlearn' 
    package to learn the networks from data and perform exact inference. 
    It offers a modification over the dynamic max-min hill climbing 'DMMHC' 
    algorithm for structure learning and the possibility to perform forecasts of
    arbitrary length. A tool for visualizing the structure of the net is also 
    provided via the 'visNetwork' package.
