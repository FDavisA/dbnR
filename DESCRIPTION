Description: The package extends the functionality offered by bnlearn to 
    perform learning and inference over dynamic Bayesian networks of arbitrary 
    Markovian order. It offers a modification over Trabelsi's dynamic max-min 
    hill climbing (DMMHC) algorithm for structure learning and the possibility 
    to perform forecasts of arbitrary length. At the moment, smoothing and 
    filtering operations are not supported. A tool for visualizating the 
    structure of the net is also provided via the visNetwork package.
